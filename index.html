            <p>Hello there! I'm Mateo, a 22-year-old student at Faculty of Informatics and Digital Technologies. Passionate about programming, data parsing, and data visualization, with a strong focus on transforming raw data into meaningful insights. I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing workflows, and leveraging technology to create efficient and scalable solutions. </p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you'll often find me hiking with a camera in hand, capturing moments and telling stories through photography. It's my way of expressing creativity and capturing the beauty of the world.</p>
            <p>I believe in continuous learning and improvement, always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow both as a developer and an artist.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch! Let's create something amazing together.</p>
